The goal of my website is to present the projects that I will work on in class in an organized way. I will also provide updates to projects or assignments I work on outside of class if it is related to creating or developing digital media. The website currently has four pages, the home page, contact, about me, and updates. I will add a page for each project I finish and update accordingly. To design the page, I chose a specific color pallete from colors I picked, and took inspiration from sources such as pinterest. I went for a minimalistic design and first made all the designs in Figma. Then, I used HTML, CSS, and javascript to implement the website. I wanted my website to have some amounts of empty space, and wanted a simplistic yet clean design. Although it is in the prelimninary stages, it will be more responsive to various screen sizes later and hopefully I will be able to implement simple animations.
