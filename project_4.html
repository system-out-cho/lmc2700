    <div class="w3-container">
      <p> After discussing our ideas for a while, we settled on the concept of a Cave Carnival. Essentially, the classical carnival game of shooting down prizes and transforming that into a digital 3D immersive experience in a cave. 
        We have seen this concept prominently as a mini-game that is otherwise part of a much grandeur project, but never as an actual video game in its own right, which led to our rationale for the game. 
        Additionally, we also wanted to incorporate a dark, primitive tone, specifically basing it on technology one would have seen in the Paleolithic era, while also incorporating some fantasy elements. 
        After we came to an agreement on our basis, we decided on key design principles: the art direction, the mechanics, which software we would utilize, and how to break up the tasks.

      <h3><b>Designing the Models</b></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>I was in charge of designing all the 3D assets for our game: Cave Carnival. I made and designed all the models in Blender, and used reference pictures from my own previous work, ChatGPT, as well as google images.
        After laying out the reference pictures, I quickly got work on creating the cave setting by adding planes and subdividing it as well as increasing the fractal property. This gave it the sharp look as shown above. I then added 
        textures and stone walls.
